Released on December 28, 2023, on itch.io, it gained significant popularity and was later launched on Steam on April 4, 2024, featuring new updates. \n\nIn Buckshot Roulette, players engage in a modified version of Russian roulette against a mysterious entity known as \"The Dealer,\" set within the eerie ambiance of an underground nightclub. The game consists of three rounds, each involving strategic decisions as players choose to shoot themselves or The Dealer, with the outcome determined by the presence of live or blank shells in the shotgun. Lives are represented by defibrillator charges, and the first to deplete all their charges loses the round. \n\nThe game offers various modes, including the challenging \"Double or Nothing\" mode, which becomes accessible after defeating The Dealer in the regular game mode. This mode introduces new items and higher stakes, enhancing replayability. In October 2024, a multiplayer mode was introduced, allowing up to four players to compete against each other, adding a dynamic social element to the game. \n\nBuckshot Roulette's unique blend of strategy, suspense, and dark humor has drawn comparisons to other games in the genre.
